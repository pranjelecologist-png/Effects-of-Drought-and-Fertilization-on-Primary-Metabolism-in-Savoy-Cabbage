# Effects-of-Drought-and-Fertilization-on-Primary-Metabolism-in-Savoy-Cabbage
This repository contains a metabolomics analysis of Savoy cabbage exploring how drought stress and fertilization, individually and in combination, affect primary metabolism. Using GC-FID, GC-MS, and multivariate statistics, the study identifies key metabolic shifts associated with stress adaptation and nutrient driven growth.
